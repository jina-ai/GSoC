# GSoC 2021
Google Summer of Code 2021


## About us


Jina is a leading neural search open source project (2.3K+ GitHub stars and 360+ forks in less than a year) and our company, Jina AI, is fully committed to open source. 

We, the Jina community, strive to be helpful and welcoming to new open source contributors. We hope that we can help give students a strong foundation of contributing to open-source artificial intelligence and neural search and learn best engineering practices through their GSoC tenure with us.

All the mentors are from our own engineering team. They will mentor and review the mentee’s deliverables in detail, with timely communication and tracking of projects’ progress, ensuring a very enriching internship experience.


## This Summer

Jina has a lot of challenging and exciting projects ongoing this summer.

Until today, we've introduced cross- and multi-modal search and have 90+ first class AI models implemented as Jina Executors in production and available as Docker images.

This year, we aim to introduce more features e.g. transfer learning, graph learning, reinforcement learning and fine tuning, and there are extensive designing and engineering work for this during this year's GSoC. 

Also, we aim to introduce and adapt even more state-of-the-art AI models in Jina Hub with the help of GSoC program. 

We look forward to contributions from our community, engineering team and interns together to successfully achieve our goals this summer.


## GSoC 2021 Idea List:

### Project 1: Hub image porting:
Adapting new state-of-the-art AI models to neural search and making them publicly available for the community via Jina Hub
Contribute to https://github.com/jina-ai/jina-hub
Mentor: [Rutuja Surve](rutuja.surve@jina.ai)

### Project 2: Improve docstring coverage for Jina
Contribute towards Jina’s code documentation, making the code highly readable.
Scope for refactoring as per best practices.
Mentor: [Rutuja Surve](rutuja.surve@jina.ai)

### Project 3: Write and example for an application of your choice 
Write a neural search pipeline to solve a problem of your choice.
Students may use any Kaggle or other publicly available datasets.
Include well-written documentation and a blog post to create outreach for yourself and Jina.
Mentor: [Rutuja Surve](rutuja.surve@jina.ai)

### Project 4:  Enhancements for JinaBox and Console
Work on exciting frontend features for enhancing JinaBox (Jina's search user-interface) and Jina's Hub interface - the console.
Mentor: [Sergiy Chemodanov](sergiy@jina.ai)
